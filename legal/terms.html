          <h6> INTRODUCTION</h6>
          <br>
          <p> Thanks for choosing iFlix Player. iFlix Player provides an advanced IPTV player for the Android and iOS
            platforms for playing your own content i.e., Videos and streams.</p>

          <p> Your agreement with us includes these Terms and any additional terms that you agree to, as discussed in the
            Entire Agreement section below, other than terms with any third parties (collectively, the “Agreements”). The
            Agreements include terms regarding future changes to the Agreements, privacy policy, disclaimers on the mobile
            applications, limitations of liability, privacy, waiver of class actions, and resolution of disputes by
            arbitration instead of in court(s).</p>
          <p> Acknowledge that you have read and understood the Agreements, accept these Agreements, and agree to be bound
            by them. If you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you must not access and/or use
            iFlix Player.</p>
          <p> In order to use the iFlix Player and access any Content,</p>
          <div class="ms-5">
            <ol type="1">
              <li>You need to be 18 years or older, or 13 years or older, and have your parent or guardian’s consent to
                the Agreements.</li>
              <li>You need to have the power to enter an Agreement with us and not be barred from doing so under any
                applicable or governing laws. You also promise that any registration information that you submit to iFlix Player is true, accurate, and complete, and you would notify iFlix Player in case of a change in any
                information so provided.</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <br>
          <h6>iFlix Player APPLICATION</h6>
          <br>
          <p> iFlix Player is available for free and you can only watch your own content i.e., videos, and streams with
            ads at zero cost. It is important to note that we do not provide any content whatsoever. Technical issues
            could occur in technology products and we may interrupt the access to iFlix Player for any maintenance or
            improvements to the player. You may be notified of such upgrades or maintenance by iFlix Player. Features
            included in this version:</p>

          <h6>CONCEPT OF ACTIVATION CODE</h6>
          <br>
          <p>
            Unlike other IPTV players, iFlix Player follows the concept of activation code for users to access their IPTV
            playlist.
            <br>
            The activation code concept allows users to generate a code from our official website, which grants them
            access to their IPTV playlist content on iFlix Player. This approach enhances user-friendliness and simplifies
            the player's usage.
  
  
          </p>
  
  
          <br>
          <h6>CHANGES TO THE AGREEMENTS</h6>
          <br>

            Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we may
            provide you with notice as appropriate under the circumstances, e.g., by displaying a prominent notice within
            the Application or by sending you an email. In some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued
            use of our product after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Therefore,
            please make sure you read any such notice carefully.</p>
