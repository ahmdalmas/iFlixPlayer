            <h6> INTRODUCTION</h6>
            <br>
            <p> Thanks for choosing iFlix Player. iFlix Player provides an advanced IPTV player for the Android and iOS
              platforms for playing your own content i.e., Videos and streams.</p>
    
            <br>
            <p> By signing up or otherwise using the iFlix Player that is made available through our Website, Play Store,

              by them. If you don’t agree with (or cannot comply with) the Agreements, then you must not access and/or use
              iFlix Player.</p>
            <p> In order to use the iFlix Player and access any Content,</p>
            <div class="ms-5">
              <ol type="1">
                <li>You need to be 18 years or older, or 13 years or older, and have your parent or guardian’s consent to
                  the Agreements.</li>

            <h6>iFlix Player APPLICATION</h6>
            <br>
            <p> iFlix Player is available for free and you can only watch your own content i.e., videos, and streams with
              ads at zero cost. It is important to note that we do not provide any content whatsoever. Technical issues
              could occur in technology products and we may interrupt the access to iFlix Player for any maintenance or
              improvements to the player. You may be notified of such upgrades or maintenance by iFlix Player. Features
              included in this version:</p>

            <h6>CONCEPT OF ACTIVATION CODE</h6>
            <br>
            <p>
              Unlike other IPTV players, iFlix Player follows the concept of activation code for users to access their IPTV
              playlist.
              <br>
              The activation code concept allows users to generate a code from our official website, which grants them
              access to their IPTV playlist content on iFlix Player. This approach enhances user-friendliness and simplifies
              the player's usage.
    
    
            </p>
    
    
            <br>
            <h6>CHANGES TO THE AGREEMENTS</h6>
            <br>
            <p> We shall reserve the right at its sole discretion, to modify, amend or replace these Agreements.
              Occasionally we may make changes to the Agreements. When we make material changes to the Agreements, we may

              the Application or by sending you an email. In some cases, we will notify you in advance, and your continued
              use of our product after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. Therefore,
              please make sure you read any such notice carefully.</p>
            <p> If you disagree with the revised terms of use then you may discontinue the use of service.</p>

              comprehensive procedure to respond to reported cases of copyright violations. We take instances of copyright
              violations very seriously and are committed to addressing them promptly.</p>
            <p> iFlix Player expeditiously handles reported cases of copyright infringement. Upon receiving a valid DMCA

          <h6>TERM AND TERMINATION</h6>
          <br>
          <p> The Agreements will continue to apply to you until terminated by either you or iFlix Player. However, you
            acknowledge and agree that the perpetual license granted by you about Feedback is irrevocable and will
            therefore continue after the expiry or termination of any of the Agreements for any reason. iFlix Player may
            terminate the Agreements or suspend your access to the iFlix Player Application at any time, including in the
            event of your actual or suspected unauthorized use of the iFlix Player Application, or non-compliance with the
            Agreements, or if we withdraw the access to the Application (in which case we shall provide you with
            reasonable notice in advance of doing so). If you or iFlix Player terminate the Agreements, or if iFlix Player
            suspends your access to the iFlix Player Application, you agree that iFlix Player shall have no liability or
            responsibility to you, and iFlix Player will not refund any amounts that you have already paid, to the fullest
            extent permitted under applicable law. You may terminate the Agreements at any time. This section will be
            enforced to the extent permissible by applicable law.</p>
          <p> Sections 7, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23 herein, as well as any other sections of the
            Agreements that, either explicitly or by their nature, must remain in effect even after termination of the
            Agreements, shall survive termination.</p>
